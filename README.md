# Fastenate
Study the EASYMODE Layouts provided located inside the `easymode/` directory of this project. Be sure you are viewing the images at **Actual Size** (100%) e.g. not zoomed in (> 100%) or out (<100%).

## Set-up (fork, clone, navigate, start Server)
After forking and cloning this repository, navigate to it in your Command-Line and run a server with the `http-server` command.

Commit often, you may create additional feature branches and use them for practice but it's not mandatory. Do commit often!

## Steps
1. Write the Markup for the layout in index.html. A file has been provided to you with copy-text, look inside the `unformatted_text.txt` file for the text.
1. Create an external stylesheet in the styles directory. Link to the stylesheet in your index.html
1. Add a CSS Reset and CSS Clearfix to your styles.
1. Import the Google fonts used in the layout: **Oswald Regular, Lato Regular**
1. Add the viewport meta tag to the head of your markup to make sure your styles are preserved for all media sizes:

  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
    
1. Style the responsive layouts, keeping in mind each media query range:
  * 769px and up
  * 481px to 768px
  * 480px and down
1. Don't forget to style 'hover' styles.

## Advanced Mode:
